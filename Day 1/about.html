    <p>My name is Calie, I'm 38 years old and I live in Bedfordshire, UK. I'm not working at the moment because I am
        retraining to become a full time software developer!</p>

    <p>In development, I would like to be responsible for my own part of a project that helps people in some way. I
        want to work with a team of decent people. I also want to help people new to coding just like a ton of people
        have helped me.</p>

        code, GirlsCodeMK, please check them out.</p>

    <h2>Three things you should know about me:</h2>

        <li>I am naturally a happy person</li>
        <li>I used to work as a car mechanic</li>
        <li>I like to cook</li>
    </ul>
